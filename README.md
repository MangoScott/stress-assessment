## How the Calculations Work

The stress assessment tool uses a simple scoring system to evaluate stress levels. Here's a breakdown of the calculation process:

1. **Scoring**: 
   - Each question is answered on a scale of 1 to 4.
   - 1 represents the least stressful response, 4 represents the most stressful response.

2. **Total Score Calculation**:
   - The scores from all five questions are summed up.
   - Minimum possible score: 5 (5 questions × 1 point)
   - Maximum possible score: 20 (5 questions × 4 points)

3. **Stress Level Categories**:
   The total score is then categorized into four stress levels:
   - 5-8 points: Low stress
   - 9-13 points: Moderate stress
   - 14-18 points: High stress
   - 19-20 points: Very high stress

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   Based on the calculated stress level, the tool provides tailored recommendations:
   - Low stress: Basic mindfulness practices to maintain well-being
   - Moderate stress: More frequent mindfulness practices and lifestyle suggestions
   - High stress: Intensive mindfulness practices and consideration of additional support
   - Very high stress: Comprehensive mindfulness program and professional consultation
